#  3D Acupuncture assistant for browsers

Acupuncture is a branch of traditional Chinese medicine based on the insertion of needles into specific points, which are connected by channels of energy and assist in health and in disease treatment.

However, the acupuncturists without extensive experience facing a problem on exact location of meridian points that should be used in patient care and, in cases where such points are known by the professional, the same must be confirmed using a theoretical framework.

Thus, this work consists of the construction of a application built with WebGl and Three.js in support of acupuncture treatment, through a dynamic tool for the query of the acupoints and a three-dimensional approach to the problem, namely, the use of 3D graphics in browsers. 

The program can be executed using the browsers Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. As the algorithm developed has linear complexity, even has a low computational cost and, by compressing of images, we make the program acceptable for a web application.

WebGl is supported by Google Chrome 46, Mozilla Firefox 42, Apple Safari 9.0,	MS Internet Explorer 11 and	MS Edge 13.
